About Me
👋 Hi, I’m FRANCIS Student

I’m learning web development and I enjoy turning ideas into simple webpages.
Fun fact: I can juggle five oranges!

I built this demo with a focus on the basics: headings, paragraphs, lists, and inline styles. My goal is to practice and then create a unique page that reflects my personality. I believe consistency matters — so I’ll keep building a little every day.
